# Consulting Graphics

Generate on-brand social media graphics from content, at the right dimensions for any platform and placement. HTML → Playwright screenshot → PNG.

Two independent choices drive every graphic:
- **Format** = the dimensions/aspect ratio (square, 4:5, story, banner, pfp, thumbnail, pin…). See `references/dimensions.md`.
- **Template** = the *composition* (layout + which color field + the dominant element). See `references/<template>.md`.

All templates share **one brand DNA** — palette, type, logo, footer — defined in
**`consulting-tasteful-design/DESIGN.md`**. That's the trick: a bold infographic and a dark quote card look like
the *same brand* without looking *the same*. Pick the template by what the content needs, and **vary it
across a series** — making everything look identical is the failure mode this kit exists to fix.

You can render the *same* template at *many* formats — that's how you create one design for every platform and size.

## Setup

**Step 0: Load the brand + the kit**

1. Read **`consulting-tasteful-design/DESIGN.md`** — the brand source of truth: the CSS palette, fonts, the
   standard footer signature (Recoup mark · Sidney Swift · recoupable.com), and the "bold, not boring"
   principles every template builds on. **Always read this before composing.** Never hardcode a value
   that disagrees with it; for anything it doesn't cover (e.g. audience), ask — don't invent.
2. Read `~/.config/consulting-graphics/.env` for `DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` + primary platform/format. If it lacks
   `SETUP_COMPLETE=true`, ask which template to default to and the primary platform/format, then write it.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the format(s).** What is being made and for where? Look up the exact dimensions, aspect ratio, file specs, and safe zone in `references/dimensions.md`. If the user names a platform but not a placement, default to the highest-engagement feed format: **1080×1350 (4:5)**.
2. **Choose the template** (the composition) by what the *content* is, not a default look: `framework-blocks` for teaching/lists/how-tos, `statement` for hooks/POVs/quotes/announcements, `stat` for a number or proof, `editorial` for the occasional restrained piece. Read `consulting-tasteful-design/DESIGN.md`, then `references/<template>.md`. Across a batch, deliberately mix them.
3. **Apply brand from `DESIGN.md`.** Use the brand name, logo SVG, and handle for footers/close slides/profile marks.
4. **Compose for the format.** Match the layout to the canvas — a 4:5 feed post, a 9:16 story, a 4:1 banner, and a circular pfp are different compositions, not the same art stretched. Respect the safe zone for the format (see dimensions.md). For multi-slide carousels, one idea per slide.
5. **Generate HTML** sized to the target canvas. Set `body { width: Wpx; height: Hpx; }`. Replace `BRAND_NAME` with the brand from `DESIGN.md`; use its logo SVG.
6. **Render to PNG** via Playwright at the matching viewport:

   ```bash
   npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size="WIDTH,HEIGHT" "file:///abs/path/graphic.html" "/abs/path/graphic.png"
   ```

7. **Review each render visually** against the safe zone and the template's quality checklist. If cluttered, split or simplify. If text is hard to read at phone scale, increase size/contrast.
8. **Iterate** until clean.

## Create once, adapt everywhere

To ship the same design across platforms and sizes:

- **Within the vertical/square family** (1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 9:16 — all 1080px wide), one HTML can serve all sizes if type and spacing use **width-relative units** (`vw`) instead of fixed `px`. Then only the canvas height changes between sizes and the composition holds. Re-render the same file at each viewport:

  ```bash
  HTML="file:///abs/path/graphic.html"
  for size in 1080,1080 1080,1350 1080,1920; do
    npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size="$size" "$HTML" "out/graphic-${size/,/x}.png"
  done
  ```

- **Landscape, banners, profile pictures, thumbnails** (16:9, 1.91:1, 3:1, 4:1, circle) have very different proportions — give them a **bespoke composition** rather than cramming the portrait layout in. Keep the same colors, type family, and logo so the set stays cohesive.
- **Keep critical content centered.** For 9:16, the *center-square method* (all key elements inside a centered 1080×1080) lets one asset survive Feed/Story/Reel crops. See dimensions.md.

## Available templates (the kit — all share `DESIGN.md`)

| Template | Field | Dominant element | Best for | Reference |
|----------|-------|------------------|----------|-----------|
| `framework-blocks` | light + dark header band | a named, color-coded framework (numbered or acronym variant) | teaching / "save this" infographics, lists, how-tos — the reach + lead-magnet engine | [references/framework-blocks.md](references/framework-blocks.md) |
| `statement` | full-bleed dark | one huge line | hooks, contrarian POVs, manifestos, quote cards, announcements | [references/statement.md](references/statement.md) |
| `stat` | dark or light | one giant number | data drops, proof, milestones, before/after | [references/stat.md](references/stat.md) |
| `editorial` | crisp light, minimal | a quiet serif headline | the occasional restrained, premium piece — **one option, not the default** | [references/editorial.md](references/editorial.md) |

> **Taste authority:** `consulting-tasteful-design` is the house north star for look-and-feel across
> every medium; this kit is its still-graphics implementation. Brand tokens (color/type/logo/footer)
> live in **`consulting-tasteful-design/DESIGN.md`** — read it first. Default is bold (`framework-blocks`); a
> single minimal template is what made everything samey, so `editorial` is one choice, not the floor.

To add a template: create `references/<name>.md` (visual identity, layout rules, a complete HTML shell
using the tokens, quality checklist). Templates own *composition*; `DESIGN.md` owns *brand*;
`dimensions.md` owns *size*.

## Dimensions & safe zones

All platform sizes, aspect ratios, file specs, profile/banner safe zones, 9:16 story safe zones, and design best practices live in **[references/dimensions.md](references/dimensions.md)**. Read it whenever choosing or adapting a format. The six canvases that cover ~90% of placements: `1080×1080` (1:1), `1080×1350` (4:5), `1080×1920` (9:16), `1920×1080` (16:9), `1200×630` (1.91:1), `1000×1500` (2:3).

## Slide/format count guidelines

- **LinkedIn carousel:** 5–10 slides (5 min for narrative, 8–10 for deep dives). Export to PDF for upload.
- **Instagram carousel:** 5–7 slides; up to 20 supported. Square or 4:5; first slide sets the ratio.
- **X thread companion:** 3–5 punchy slides.
- **Single graphics** (hero post, quote card, announcement): one strong composition beats a thin carousel.

## Content principles

The full "bold, not boring" stance + the anti-AI-slop checklist live in **`consulting-tasteful-design`**
(`DESIGN.md`). The essentials:

- Every graphic/slide earns its place — if it adds no new idea, cut it.
- **Commit to a color field** (full-bleed dark or crisp light). No pale washed-out gradients — that's the slop tell.
- **One thing is huge** — a hook, a number, or a framework, legible as a thumbnail.
- **Color carries meaning:** `--accent` for structure, one `--signal` pop for the eye-hit. Never rainbow.
- **Make it saveable:** real numbers, named frameworks, worked examples (specificity is the design).
- The hook (slide 1 / the headline) decides whether anyone engages — spend disproportionate effort there.
- **Vary the template across a series.** Sameness is the failure mode this kit exists to fix.
- Mobile-first: if it doesn't read at phone-thumbnail scale, it fails.

## Output

Save PNGs to the output directory (e.g. `slide-0.png … slide-N.png`, or `graphic-1080x1350.png` for single/multi-size). Keep HTML source alongside for iteration.
