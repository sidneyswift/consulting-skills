# Skill Roadmap

Every repeatable workflow in the playbook, mapped to a skill we can author with `/skill-creator`.
Rule of the practice: **anything done more than once becomes a skill.** Each skill lives in
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, then gets packaged into a plugin and installed so it triggers
non-deterministically (see `skills/_packaging/README.md`).

Status legend: ✅ built (all 26 now authored). Priority: **P0** = highest leverage. Next step: package + install so they auto-trigger (consulting-skill-packager).

## P0 — The spine of the operating system (build first)

- **Does:** place raw file (dated) → read → run content-extraction + (if discovery) discovery-analysis → scan the related client/deal folder → update client README, `pipeline/_board.md`, `operating-system/dashboard.html` → move folders if stage changed → mine for content/proof → report changes.
- **Reads → writes:** `content/raw/`, `clients/*`, `pipeline/*` → updates dashboards, boards, KB.
- **Source:** CLAUDE.md auto-manage loop (synthesizes Ch. 4, 11, 17).

## Recommended build order
1. **P0 spine:** `consulting-call-processor` + `consulting-lead-intake` (the 3 existing P0 skills already cover extraction/discovery/proposal).
2. **P1 sales:** pricing-builder, followup-sequencer, objection-handler, deal-stage-mover.
3. **P1 content + client:** content-drafter, friday-review, client-onboarding, quarterly-value-review, testimonial-capture.
4. **P1 meta:** skill-packager (so everything above can be installed and auto-trigger).
5. **P2/P3:** ops, positioning, system-auditor as the practice scales.

Skills marked "scheduled task" candidates (friday-review, quarterly-value-review, metrics-updater)
can also be wired to run automatically on a cadence.
