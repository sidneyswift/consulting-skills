# Consulting Prospect Resurrection

The cheapest pipeline is warm relationships that already know you. Mine the Granola archive for
dormant prospects and turn them into ranked, personalized re-engagement.

## Steps
1. **Find the cold set.** Scan `integrations/granola/Recoup/prospects/` (and `_intro-calls/`) for
   each prospect's **last meeting date**. Flag anything dormant (e.g. >90 days). Sort by recency.
2. **Cross-reference Attio (live).** Skip anyone already an active deal/client. Note who's a
   `product-user` vs a real lapsed lead.
3. **Ground each one.** Read the prospect's latest Granola note(s) and pull: the buyer/champion,
   their **stated pain in their words**, what was discussed, and the likely reason it stalled.
   (Remember: Granola bodies are AI summaries — confirm specifics, don't fabricate.)
4. **Rank** by fit to the ICP (`positioning/`) × pain intensity × deal ceiling. Big logos and
   well-articulated pain rise to the top.
5. **Draft re-engagement** per prospect: a value-first opener that references *their* stakes (not a
   pitch), plus a 3-touch cadence (use `consulting-followup-sequencer`). Mark all as drafts to review.
6. **Write the report** to `pipeline/_cold-prospect-resurrection-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (ranked table + angles).
7. **Enter the top picks** into the pipeline: create the Attio deal (stage Lead) and a
   `pipeline/01-leads/<prospect>/` folder with a grounded dashboard + `followups.md`.

Output: a prioritized resurrection report + live leads in Attio and the pipeline.
