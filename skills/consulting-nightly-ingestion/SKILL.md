name: consulting-nightly-ingestion
description: The autonomous nightly sweep. Runs unattended (cloud routine or local cron) to ingest the day's new meetings, emails, and LinkedIn engagement, run the full auto-manage loop on each new item, update dashboards/board/CRM, commit, and leave a morning digest. Use on "run the nightly sweep", "ingest today", "catch the OS up", or as the scheduled nightly ritual. Full autopilot, inside the three standing safety rails.

# Consulting Nightly Ingestion (autopilot)

The hands-off version of the CLAUDE.md auto-manage loop. It assumes **no human is watching**, so it
does the safe work fully autonomously and is *stricter*, not looser, on anything it can't verify.

`consulting-integrations-sync` is the **pull** half (gets new material in + advances watermarks).
This skill wraps it with the **process** half (extract → reconcile → update → commit) and a
**morning digest**. Run end to end, commit as you go, then write the digest. Do not stop to ask —
park anything uncertain in the digest's "Needs you" section instead.

## The three standing rails (never dropped under autopilot)
Autopilot means "no human in the loop," not "skip the rails." These come straight from CLAUDE.md:

1. **Never auto-send.** Every follow-up email / LinkedIn reply is a **draft only**
   (`integrations/gmail/_work/create_draft.py`; revise in place with `--update <id>`, never
   delete-and-recreate). List drafts in the digest for the user to send.
2. **Verify before you write money/dates/stage.** Every `$`, %, date, MRR/fee, or who-pays-whom claim
   that lands in a dashboard, board, dossier, or the CRM must be quoted from a **primary source** —
   the **verbatim Granola transcript** (`?include=transcript`, *not* the AI summary body), the actual
   email, the contract, or a **live Attio field**. If you cannot quote it, write **[UNVERIFIED]** and
   route it to the digest's "Needs you" — do **not** assert it. Money is highest-stakes.
3. **Never auto-delete or bulk-sweep.** Add and update only. Never delete or batch-edit a mailbox or
   external record. Act only on an ID you created **this run**, never a pattern/search/list match.

## Steps

0. **Orient (git = memory).** `git log --oneline -20`; `git show`/`git log -p` on paths you expect to
   touch. Read the touched deal/client `AGENTS.md` before changing it. Confirm the env keys are present
   (`GRANOLA_API_KEY`, `GMAIL`/`GWS_*`, `ATTIO_API_KEY`, `APIFY_API_TOKEN`, `POSTBRIDGE_API_KEY`,
   `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`/`SLACK_USER_TOKEN`/`SLACK_APP_TOKEN`).
   If a key is missing, skip that source and note it in the digest — never guess its data.

1. **Pull (delegate to `consulting-integrations-sync`).** Run it for the live API sources only:
   **Attio** (query live, reconcile stage ↔ folder), **Granola** (re-pull deltas since `_work`),
   **Gmail** (pull deal/client threads, flag awaiting-my-reply), **LinkedIn** (refresh engagement),
   and **Slack** (deal-tied channels per its Slack step — bounded `--days` off `LAST_SYNCED`, never an
   unbounded backfill; routing table in `integrations/slack/AGENTS.md`). It advances each source's
   `LAST_SYNCED` — that watermark is what keeps this idempotent, so a re-run never re-ingests yesterday.
   **Skip the research wiki** here: it's a *local* sibling repo
   (`../research`) the cloud routine can't see, and it's content-only — leave it to the local Friday
   review (`consulting-friday-review`).

2. **Process each NEW item through the auto-manage loop** (CLAUDE.md §"Auto-manage"). For every new
   meeting / thread / engagement the pull surfaced, **deal-scoped** (never cross Recoup ⇄ SwiftResponse
   in one item — Granola's don't-cross-jobs rule):
   - **Place** the raw file in its home (`clients/<client>/meetings/` or `…/slack/`,
     `pipeline/<stage>/<deal>/`, `knowledge/product/` for internal product DMs, or `content/raw/`),
     dated `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - **Extract** → `consulting-content-extraction` (insights → `knowledge/insights/`, candidates →
     `content/ideas/`). Discovery call → also `consulting-discovery-analysis`; qualified → chain
     `consulting-proposal-drafting`.
   - **Reconcile** the related folder: read its `AGENTS.md`, fix drift against the new info + live Attio.
   - **Update** all affected files: the deal/client `AGENTS.md` dashboard (status, stakes, $, next
     action), `pipeline/_board.md`, `business/metrics/dashboard.html`. New stakeholders, decisions, dates.
   - **Move on stage change:** `consulting-deal-stage-mover` (folder + board + Attio in lockstep;
     `pipeline/**` ↔ `clients/**` on win) — but only with a primary-source signal for the move
     (rail #2); if the signal is ambiguous, stage the recommendation in the digest instead of moving.
   - **Mine:** new won deal → `consulting-case-study-builder`; recurring answer → `knowledge/faqs/`;
     reusable win → `proof/` ask.

3. **Apply the rails** (above) to everything step 2 produced: outbound → drafts; unverifiable figures →
   `[UNVERIFIED]` + digest; no deletes.

4. **Commit (the commit *is* the episodic memory).** Commit each meaningful change with a clear,
   why-first message. Group sensibly (one commit per deal/item is fine). If you changed a skill in the
   `plugin/` submodule, commit there too.

5. **Write the morning digest** → `business/ops/nightly-digests/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (create the folder if
   missing). Keep it skimmable for a 30-second morning read:
   - **Ingested** — what came in (N meetings, N threads, N engagements), each one line with its home.
   - **Changed** — dashboards/board/CRM updates made, stage moves, new content ideas/insights.
   - **Needs you** — the queue the rails parked: drafts awaiting send, `[UNVERIFIED]` figures to
     confirm, ambiguous stage moves, missing keys/sources. This is the section the user actually acts on.
   - **Commits** — the `git log --oneline` for the run, so the digest ties back to the memory.

6. **Stop.** Do not send, do not delete, do not ask. The digest's "Needs you" is the handoff.

## Notes
- **Idempotent by watermark.** Correctness depends on `LAST_SYNCED`/`LAST_MINED` being honored and
  advanced. If a source has no new items since its marker, that's a clean no-op — say so in one line.
- **Subagents are leads, not facts.** If you dispatch one to read/derive, require source file+line or
  verbatim quote for every quantitative claim, label the rest `[UNVERIFIED]`, and re-verify its numbers
  against the primary source yourself before writing them anywhere.
- **Quiet nights are fine.** No new material → write a one-line digest ("nothing new since <date>") and
  commit nothing. Don't manufacture work.
