description: Engine B of the demand engine — turn shipped, user-facing product work (merged PRs / releases) into staged feature-announcement bundles (email + LinkedIn/X post + explainer video), grounded and cited to the PRs, never auto-sent. This is the build->content half of the flywheel (Engine A is calls->content). Use on "turn our shipped PRs into content", "announce what we shipped", "run the product engine", or as the (planned) 4th nightly lane. NOTE: deploying this unattended is blocked on decision B1 (which Recoup repo(s) to watch + a cloud-worker GitHub auth path) — until then, run it on demand.

# Consulting Product Engine (Engine B — product → feature content)

Engine A turns calls/insights into thought leadership. **Engine B turns shipped product work into
demand.** Every PR that ships a user-facing change is a **signal** (`source.type: pr`); this skill
turns those signals into the feature-announcement formats Sid sent by hand to Recoup users in 2025
(`library/email-templates/email-feature-announcement.md` — 7 real, proven sends), now automated and
**staged for approval, never auto-sent**.

Same **idea-bundle shape** and same **approval queue** as Engine A — a product update is just a bundle
whose `source` is a PR/release instead of a call.

> **Status:** 🟡 logic scaffolded; **source connector ✅ built** (`integrations/github/_work/pull_prs.py`
> pulls merged PRs tokenless). **Decision B1 is resolved** — watch the **public** `recoupable` org, no token
> needed. Still on demand until filter→fan is proven end-to-end and a cadence is chosen; then it earns a
> `routines/` run file + `SPEC.md` block (a 4th nightly lane). Design: `docs/plans/2026-06-30-demand-engine-restructure-spec.md` §"Engine B".

## Prerequisite — the source connector (built)
Reads merged PRs from the **public `recoupable` org** via `integrations/github/_work/pull_prs.py`
(GitHub Search API, **unauthenticated — no token**; optional read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` only for rate-limit
headroom). GitHub owns truth; the repo keeps only the distilled "what shipped" + a `LAST_SYNCED`.
**Watches the product org, not this consulting-os repo.** See `integrations/github/AGENTS.md` (B1 resolved).

## The flow
```text
pull merged PRs since integrations/github/_work/LAST_SYNCED   (python3 integrations/github/_work/pull_prs.py — tokenless)
  → FILTER to user-facing changes    (drop refactors / chores / deps / tests / infra / internal-only)
  → CLUSTER related PRs into ONE feature   (5 PRs building one capability = one announcement, not five)
  → JUDGE "shippable to users"       (is it live / flag-on? does it change what a user can DO? tie to release notes/tags)
  → write a cited "what shipped, for users" line per feature   (traces to the PR/commit — never invented)
  → write product-update SIGNALS into signals/   (type: product-update, source.type: pr, locator: commit sha / PR #)
  → per feature, create an idea bundle and fan the formats:
       meta.yml     (engine: B — the approval state machine)
       email.md     (the proven feature-announcement format)
       linkedin.md + x.md   (build-in-public / demo post)
       video/       (consulting-hyperframes-video — explainer / demo clip)
       images/
  → stage in content/03-drafts/<date>-<feature-slug>/
  → STOP for Sid approval (never auto-send)
```

## The hard part: PR → "user-facing feature" (do in order)
Most PRs are not announceable. The judgment, in order:
1. **Filter out** refactors, chores, dependency bumps, tests, infra, internal-only changes.
2. **Cluster** related PRs into one feature — don't announce the same capability five times.
3. **Judge "shippable to users"** — is it live / flag-on, and does it change what a user can *do*? Tie
   to release notes / tags when present.
4. **Write one line: "what shipped, for users," cited to the PRs.** Evidence discipline (root
   `CLAUDE.md`): the claim traces to the PR/commit (PR #, commit sha, or a verbatim title), never
   invented — same bar as Engine A's grounding. **Build/commit activity ≠ adoption** — announce what
   shipped, not usage you can't prove.

`⟡ DECISION B2: the filter signal — a `user-facing` label we add in the product repo (cleanest) vs
title/path heuristics vs only release tags.`

## Per-feature formats (reuse what exists)
- **`email.md`** — the **feature-announcement format** (`library/email-templates/email-feature-announcement.md`):
  subject = the outcome ("It booked a guest in 5 minutes"), open with the pain or the new power, **prove
  it** (a live test / demo / 2-3 copy-paste prompts), **one deep-link CTA into the product**, founder
  sign-off. Strip em-dashes/hype per `consulting-copywriting` (the 2025 copy predates the voice rules).
- **`video/`** — `consulting-hyperframes-video` explainer/demo (or package a provided screen capture).
- **`linkedin.md` + `x.md`** — build-in-public / demo posts. `images/` as needed.
- Edit gates: `consulting-copy-editor` on each format; `consulting-copy-reviewer` (customer POV) on the email.

## Audience & dispatch (reuses the email engine)
- The feature-email is **broadcast/nurture** → routes via the existing matrix (`email/AGENTS.md`):
  product updates → customers + warm + (gated) targets; segments resolve via live Attio **at dispatch**.
- Dispatch rail = `integrations/gmail/_work/create_draft.py` (drafts only). **Never auto-send.**
- `⟡ DECISION B3: add feature-announcement as email-atomizer format #12, or Engine B owns it directly
  (today the atomizer has formats 06-11; feature-announcement is a swipe file being promoted to a format).`

## Output — one idea bundle (same shape as Engine A)
```
content/03-drafts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature-slug>/
  meta.yml     id · title · date · engine: B · source (the PR/release) · formats[] each status: draft
  email.md     the feature-announcement (deep-link CTA into the product)
  linkedin.md  build-in-public / demo post
  video/       explainer or demo clip (optional)
  images/      image1.png = hero/preview, then image2.png…
```

## Rails
1. **Never auto-send / auto-publish.** Everything stages at `status: draft`; Sid approves per format.
2. **Grounded, cited to the PR.** Every "what shipped" claim carries a PR #/commit sha; unproven → don't
   ship it. Announce shipped capability, never claimed adoption.
3. **One feature = one bundle.** Cluster; don't spam a bundle per PR.
4. **Voice = `consulting-copywriting`**; edit gates before staging.
5. **Watches the product repo, not consulting-os.**

## Open decisions
- **B1 — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-30):** watch the **public `recoupable` org**, read **tokenless** via
  `pull_prs.py`. No PAT/App needed (optional read-only token only for rate-limit headroom).
- **B2** — the user-facing filter signal. Grounded default from the real PR stream: **conventional-commit
  prefix** — keep `feat(...)`; drop `chore`/`test`/`ci`/`build`/`refactor`/`docs` + bare "Test" PRs; treat
  `fix:` as user-facing only if it names a user-visible symptom. Confirm, or add a `user-facing` PR label.
- **B3** — feature-announcement as email-atomizer format #12 vs. Engine B owns it directly.

## New pieces (build order)
1. `integrations/github/` — the merged-PR pull (`pull_prs.py`) + `LAST_SYNCED`. **✅ built + verified.**
2. This skill. **✅ scaffolded.**
3. Promote the feature-announcement swipe file → a reusable format. **✅ done.**
4. **Next:** prove filter→cluster→cite→fan on real PRs (one bundle), decide B2/B3, then add a
   `routines/consulting-product-engine.md` run file + a `SPEC.md` block (its own nightly lane).

## Connection to `products/` (distinct, adjacent)
`products/` decides *what to build* (demand → score → ship); Engine B announces *what shipped*. They
meet at `source:` — a `products/05-shipped/` card or its PRs trigger Engine B; Engine B's engagement
(demo clicks, replies) feeds **revealed-demand signals back into `products/_signals.md`**. Neither owns
the other.
